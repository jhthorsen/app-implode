NAME
    App::Implode - Pack an application into a single runable file

VERSION
    0.01

DESCRIPTION
    App::Implode is an alternative to App::FatPacker and App::fatten. It
    works by using Carton to build all the dependencies and then bundle all
    the deps to a single executable file.

    It is very important that all the dependencies are documented in a
    cpanfile. Example "cpanfile":

      requires "perl", '5.12.0';
      requires "Mojolicious" => 5.00;

SYNOPSIS
      $ cd my-project
      $ implode myapp.pl out.pl

CAVEAT
    App::Implode will put all the requirements into an bzip2'ed archive, and
    write it into the generated file, in the "__END__" section. This means
    that you cannot use this section in the source script.
