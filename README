NAME
    App::Implode - Pack an application into a single runable file

VERSION
    0.03

DESCRIPTION
    App::Implode is an alternative to App::FatPacker and App::fatten. It
    works by using Carton to build all the dependencies and then bundle all
    the deps to a single executable file.

    It is very important that all the dependencies are documented in a
    cpanfile. Example "cpanfile":

      requires "perl" => "5.12.0";
      requires "Mojolicious" => "5.00";

SYNOPSIS
  Generetor
      $ cd my-project
      $ implode myapp.pl out.pl

  Consumer
    It is possible to set environment variables on the consumer side to
    instruct how the code will be "exploded".

      $ out.pl
      $ APP_EXPLODE_VERBOSE=1 out.pl
      $ APP_EXPLODE_DIR=/extract/files/here out.pl

    *   APP_EXPLODE_VERBOSE

        Set this to a true value to get debug output.

    *   APP_EXPLODE_DIR

        The default is to put the extracted files in a default tmpdir. A
        custom "APP_EXPLODE_DIR" can be specified if to override that
        behavior.

CAVEAT
    App::Implode will put all the requirements into an bzip2'ed archive, and
    write it into the generated file, in the "__END__" section. This means
    that you cannot use this section in the source script.
